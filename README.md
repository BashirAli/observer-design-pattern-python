# observer-design-pattern-python
The purpose of this repo is the following

1. have some fun with design patterns,
2. display to employers my Python Programming capabilities

The idea is to imitate GCP PubSub infrastructure as best as possible using the Observer design pattern with only pure Python 
The main.yaml file shows configuration of a persons setup - based on this file, the program will create the necessary observers
